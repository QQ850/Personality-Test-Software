## Describtion: 
Scoring users’ responses to the classic Myers–Briggs personality test. Assume that the test has 70 questions that determine a person’s personality in four dimensions. Each question has two answer choices that we’ll call the “A” and “B” answers. Questions are organized into 10 groups of seven questions, with the following repeating pattern in each group:

* The first question in each group (questions 1, 8, 15, 22, etc.) tells whether the person is introverted or extroverted.

* The next two questions (questions 2 and 3, 9 and 10, 16 and 17, 23 and 24, etc.) test whether the person is guided by his or her senses or intuition.

* The next two questions (questions 4 and 5, 11 and 12, 18 and 19, 25 and 26, etc.) test whether the person focuses on thinking or feeling.

* The final two questions in each group (questions 6 and 7, 13 and 14, 20 and 21, 27 and 28, etc.) test whether the person prefers to judge or be guided by perception.


In other words, if we consider introversion/extraversion (I/E) to be dimension 1, sensing/intuition (S/N) to be dimension 2, thinking/feeling (T/F) to be dimension 3, and judging/perception (J/P) to be dimension 4, the map of questions to their respective dimensions would look like this:
